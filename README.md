## 📖 Introduction

BNOS (Bionic Neural Network Operating System) is a general-purpose modular execution engine based on bionic neural networks. The system adopts a brain-inspired architecture where multiple collaborative nodes are combined to build various application systems. It can be used for plugin-based systems, automation pipelines, task scheduling, edge computing, microservices, and other scenarios, as well as for building AI agents. Each node is the smallest execution unit in the system (similar to neurons or functional modules in the brain), and multiple nodes communicate and collaborate through JSON files to jointly realize complex business logic and processing capabilities.

## 🧬 Design Philosophy

This system draws inspiration from the core characteristics of biological neural networks, mapped to general-purpose modular execution scenarios:

- **Functional Nodes (Neurons)**: Each node functions like a neuron or functional module in the brain, responsible for specific subtask processing
- **Node Collaboration (Neural Circuits)**: Multiple nodes connect through data files, forming a collaboration network within the system
- **Attention Mechanism**: Task filtering based on rules simulates the attention focusing mechanism of nodes
- **Duplicate Processing Prevention**: Automatically marks processed tasks to avoid nodes repeatedly executing the same operations (improves efficiency)
- **Modular Design**: Flexibly build various application systems with complex capabilities by combining nodes with different functions

## ⚡ High Concurrency Design Philosophy

BNOS does not require all nodes to support high concurrency, but adopts a brain-inspired architecture:

1. **High-Performance Node Implementation**: High concurrency and high-performance requirements (such as LLM inference, large-scale computing, high-frequency access) are implemented only within individual specialized nodes
2. **Flexible Technology Stack**: These nodes can freely use multi-threading, multi-processing, coroutines, third-party engines, and other technologies without framework restrictions
3. **Lightweight Node Stability**: Other nodes are only responsible for task perception, attention filtering, decision scheduling, and result storage, maintaining lightweight stability
4. **Minimalist Communication**: Inter-node communication is achieved through files, avoiding the complexity of distributed systems
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Nodes can be implemented in different languages (Python, Rust, C++, etc.) based on performance requirements, all communicating through unified JSON protocol

This architecture makes the system both simple and stable, while enabling extreme performance in critical nodes.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Upper Task (upper_data.json)
    ↓
Listener (listener.py) ← Attention Filtering (node attention mechanism)
    ↓
Node Processing Logic (main.py) ← Functional Unit Execution
    ↓
Output to Next Node (output.json) ← Inter-Node Communication
```

### Core Components

- **listener.py / listener.rs**: Node listener responsible for monitoring upper tasks, executing attention filtering, and calling node processing logic
- **main.py / main.rs**: Node processing logic implementing execution logic for specific functional units within the agent
- **config.json**: Node configuration file defining node name, listening path, attention rules, etc.
- **packet.py / packet.rs**: Data packet structure definition file (inter-node communication format)
- **create_node.py / rust_create_node.py**: Node creation tools that automatically generate complete node structures (Python/Rust)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports Python, Rust, and other language implementations, all using unified JSON communication protocol

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **Environment Isolation**: Each node has its own independent Python virtual environment (venv), ensuring independence of functional units within the system
- 🎯 **Attention Mechanism**: Supports precise task filtering based on field values; nodes only focus on qualifying tasks (simulates attention focusing)
- 📝 **Duplicate Processing Prevention**: Automatically marks processed tasks to avoid nodes repeatedly executing the same operations (improves system efficiency)
- 📊 **Logging System**: Comprehensive node activity logging with both file and console output for tracking system behavior
- 🚀 **Modular Construction**: Provides node generator for one-click creation of standardized functional nodes, enabling rapid combination to build various application systems
- 💻 **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS systems
- 🌐 **General-Purpose Workflow Orchestration**: Supports building complex workflows, data pipelines, microservice components, etc. by combining multiple nodes
- 🔌 **Pluggable Design**: Node logic is independently encapsulated, allowing easy replacement, upgrade, or addition of new functional nodes to flexibly adjust system capabilities, suitable for plugin systems, automation toolchains, and other scenarios

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**For Python Nodes:**
- Python 3.6+
- pip (for creating virtual environments)

**For Rust Nodes:**
- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
- Verify installation: `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`

### Create Functional Nodes

#### Option 1: Python Node (Recommended for Rapid Development)

1. Run the node creation tool in the project root directory:

```bash
python python_create_node.py
```

2. Enter the node name (e.g., data_processor, api_handler, task_scheduler), and the system will automatically generate:
   - Complete node directory structure
   - Independent Python virtual environment
   - Standard configuration file
   - Startup scripts (Windows: `start.bat` / Linux: `start.sh`)

#### Option 2: Rust Node (Recommended for High Performance)

1. Run the Rust node creation tool:

```bash
python rust_create_node.py
```

2. Enter the node name, and the system will automatically generate:
   - Complete Rust project structure
   - Cargo.toml configuration
   - Source code templates (main.rs, listener.rs, packet.rs)
   - Startup scripts with auto-build capability

### Configure Node Attention

Edit the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "node_name": "data_processor",           // Node name (functional unit ID)
  "listen_upper_file": "../data/upper_data.json",  // Path to upper task file (input channel)
  "output_file": "./output.json",     // Output file path (output channel)
  "filter": {                         // Attention filtering rules (attention mechanism)
    "type": "data_task"
  },
  "output_type": "data_result"         // Output data type identifier
}
```

### Write Node Processing Logic

**For Python Nodes:** Implement the `process()` function in `main.py`:

```python
def process(data):
    """Process input task and return results (functional unit execution)"""
    value = data.get("data", 0)
    return float(value) + 1
```

**For Rust Nodes:** Implement the `process()` function in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn process(data: &serde_json::Value) -> Option<serde_json::Value> {
    // Implement your business logic here
    let input = data.get("data")?;
    
    // Process data...
    let result = /* your processing logic */;
    
    Some(result)
}
```

### Start Functional Node

**Python Node:**

Windows:
```bash
cd node_python_demo
start.bat
```

Linux/macOS:
```bash
cd node_python_demo
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Rust Node:**

Windows:
```bash
cd node_rust_demo
start.bat
```

Linux/macOS:
```bash
cd node_rust_demo
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The Rust node will automatically build the project on first run or when source code changes are detected.

## 📋 Configuration Guide

### config.json Parameters

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `node_name` | string | Unique node identifier (functional unit ID) | `"data_processor"` |
| `listen_upper_file` | string | Upper task file path (relative or absolute, input channel) | `"../data/upper_data.json"` |
| `output_file` | string | This node's output file path (output channel) | `"./output.json"` |
| `filter` | object | Attention filtering rules, key-value pair matching (attention mechanism) | `{"type": "data_task"}` |
| `output_type` | string | Output data type identifier (result type) | `"data_result"` |

### Attention Filtering Mechanism (Node Attention)

- If `filter` is an empty object `{}`, the node processes all tasks (broad attention)
- If filtering rules are configured, tasks are processed only when they contain all specified fields with exact value matches (focused attention)
- Example: `{"type": "data_task"}` means the node only focuses on tasks with `type` field value of `"data_task"`

### Data Packet Format (Inter-Node Communication)

**Input Task Packet** (`upper_data.json`):
```json
{
  "type": "data_task",
  "data": 153,
  "_processed_data_processor": true
}
```

**Output Result Packet** (`output.json`):
```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "type": "data_result",
  "data": 154
}
```

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Adding Dependencies

**For Python Nodes:** Add required Python packages to the node's `requirements.txt` file:

```
requests==2.28.0
numpy==1.23.0
openai==1.0.0
```

Then activate the virtual environment and install:

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For Rust Nodes:** Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
chrono = "0.4"
# Add other dependencies...
```

Then build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **View Logs**: Check `logs/listener.log` to understand node operation status (internal agent activity monitoring)
2. **Monitor Data**: Observe changes in `upper_data.json` and `output.json` (internal agent signal flow tracking)
3. **Test Attention**: Modify the `filter` rules in `config.json` to verify task filtering (attention adjustment)

### Log Format

```
[2026-04-24 17:26:11] [INFO] ✅ This is my task, starting processing
[2026-04-24 17:26:11] [INFO] ✅ Processing complete | Marked: _processed_perception_node
[2026-04-24 17:26:12] [ERROR] ❌ Task packet format error
```

## 🔄 Workflow (Node Collaborative Processing)

1. **Task Reception**: `listener.py` continuously monitors the `upper_data.json` file (node receives tasks from upstream nodes)
2. **Attention Filtering**: Determines whether to process the task based on `filter` rules in `config.json` (node attention focusing)
3. **Duplicate Check**: Checks if the task has been processed by the current node (via `_processed_<node_name>` marker, avoiding duplicate execution)
4. **Node Processing**: Calls `main.py` to execute node functional logic, passing JSON task as command-line arguments (functional unit execution)
5. **Output Results**: Writes processing results to `output.json` (node output, passed to downstream nodes)
6. **Mark Completion**: Adds processing markers to `upper_data.json` to prevent duplicate processing (task completion marking)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **JSON Format**: Ensure all JSON files are properly formatted, otherwise parsing errors will occur
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure nodes have read/write permissions for data files
3. **Virtual Environment**: Each node must use an independent virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts
4. **Concurrency Safety**: The current version does not support running multiple instances of the same node simultaneously
5. **Path Configuration**: Paths in configuration files can be relative or absolute
6. **System Design**: When designing systems, reasonably combine multiple nodes to form complete processing capabilities

- Verify that `upper_data.json` format is correct

### Q: How to reset node processing state?
A: Manually delete the `_processed_<node_name>` field from `upper_data.json` (clear node memory)

### Q: Virtual environment creation failed?
A: Ensure Python is installed and the `python -m venv` command is available

### Q: How to build a complete application system?
A: Create multiple functional nodes (such as data processing nodes, business logic nodes, API nodes, etc.), configure their `listen_upper_file` and `output_file` to form collaborative workflows, jointly constituting a complete application system. It can also be used to build AI agents by combining perception nodes, reasoning nodes, decision nodes, etc. to implement agent functionality.

### Q: How to choose between Python and Rust nodes?
A: 
- **Choose Python** when: Rapid prototyping, easy debugging, rich ecosystem libraries needed, moderate performance requirements
- **Choose Rust** when: Maximum performance required, memory safety critical, low-latency processing, production environment stability

### Q: Can I mix Python and Rust nodes in the same system?
A: Yes! All nodes communicate through standardized JSON files regardless of implementation language. You can freely combine Python and Rust nodes in the same workflow.
